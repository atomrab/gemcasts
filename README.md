This repository is meant to house a live online version of experiments with the reflectance transformation imaging of a large number of plaster casts of the impressions of ancient and Neoclassical intaglio gems. The web viewer used was developed by Gianpaolo Palma at ISTI-CNR (http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/rti/webviewer.php).
